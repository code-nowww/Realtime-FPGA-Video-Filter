Package used: cv2

Mark that
1. the file will be stored into the folder which is the
same as the source .jpg file.
2. each 12-bit data of the coe file is organized
as the order of BGR. That is the bit [11:8] is for Blue,
[7:4] for Green and [3:0] for Red. You should to pay
attention for this when using in VGA displaying.

# Describe: use this function to generate coe file.
